# Application Framework

## Context and Problem Statement
The application framework that I am most familiar with is Spring Boot and 
I prefer to use it for my personal and work projects. The project requirements requested I do whatever was simplest for me.

## Considered Options

* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - Very easy to prototype, but I haven't used in a few years. 
  Probably would have been faster to complete project.
    
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Fairly easy to prototype and would handle the json returned from the REST requests well.


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Spring Boot", because

* It is easy for me to get started and design within Java
* Spring Boot handles configuration and injection without a lot of mess
* I like the Spock testing framework and running Component tests with SpringBootTest bringing up the web app for running tests
